# Changelog

All notable changes to irlume are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-03

First public release. Local infrared face authentication for Linux —
clean-BOM, TPM-sealed, engineered to meet or beat Windows Hello. The password
is always the fallback: no lockout, ever.

### Added

- **Privilege-separated architecture** — a thin `pam_irlume.so` module and
  `irlume` CLI are untrusted clients of a privileged `irlumed` daemon (the only
  component that touches the camera, IR emitter, models, templates, or TPM),
  over a `SO_PEERCRED`-authenticated Unix socket.
- **Clean model bill-of-materials**, all permissive & GPLv3-compatible, bundled:
  YuNet (MIT) detection, AuraFace 512-D ArcFace (Apache-2.0) recognition,
  self-built algorithmic IR liveness, and opt-in passive blink liveness via
  MediaPipe FaceMesh (Apache-2.0) eye-aspect-ratio.
- **Encrypted at rest** — templates are 512-D embeddings only (never images),
  AES-256-GCM encrypted under a key the TPM seals to boot state. Disk-theft
  tested: sealed data is undecryptable on another machine.
- **Hardware tiers** — IR camera → Secure (login, `sudo`, lock screen, keyring
  unlock); RGB-only → Convenience (screen unlock only); optional fingerprint
  companion factor.
- **TPM-sealed keyring unlock** — a face login unseals the login password and
  hands it to gnome-keyring / KWallet, so the wallet opens with no prompt.
- **Method/tier/login-manager-aware PAM wiring** (`irlume login enable`) for
  GDM, SDDM, and Plasma `plasmalogin`; opt-in, never auto-wired on install.
- **Guided TUI** (`irlume tui`) for enrollment, configuration, live status, and
  a Repair tab that detects and fixes common issues.
- **Packaging for all three families** — Fedora RPM (Copr/Packit), Arch
  PKGBUILD, Debian/Ubuntu `.deb` (nfpm). onnxruntime is bundled on Fedora and
  Debian/Ubuntu; Arch uses the system package.

### Security

- ISO/IEC 30107-3 PAD self-test tooling (`padcapture` / `padreport`) with
  per-species APCER / BPCER / ACER and exact-binomial confidence intervals.
- SO_PEERCRED + operation-class biopolicy gate on credential release;
  bounded request size and read/write timeouts on the daemon socket.

### Known limitations

- Passive blink liveness is a deterrent, not a guarantee: a determined
  life-size glossy print can still slip through occasionally, and it does not
  cover glasses-wearers — every miss falls safely to the password.
- RGB-only laptops get the Convenience tier by design (face never releases
  credentials).
- Not lab-certified: self-tested against ISO/IEC 30107-3, no paid iBeta pass.
