//! Decision rule (NIST SP 800-63B-4 aligned): grant only if the liveness gate

//! across demographics. Threshold is NOT ported from linhello (0.60) — AuraFace's
//! score scale differs; derive it from a genuine/impostor ROC on real data.
//!
//! Storage: never store a raw recoverable face image. Store L2-normalized
//! embeddings (zeroized after use). The unlock SECRET (e.g. the login password
//! or a random release token) is SEALED IN THE TPM, gated by PCR policy, and
//! released only on a successful live+match — not the template itself.
